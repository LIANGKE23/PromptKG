## Release

**\*\*\*\*\* ```January, 2022```: [GenKGC](https://github.com/zjunlp/PromptKGC/tree/main/GenKGC) | [KG-Prompt](https://github.com/zjunlp/PromptKGC/tree/main/KGPrompt) release \*\*\*\*\***

- [x] [**GenKGC**](https://github.com/zjunlp/PromptKGC/tree/main/GenKGC) (Jaunary 31, 2020): GenKGC converts knowledge graph completion to sequence-to-sequence generation with pre-trained language model with relation-guided demonstration and entity-aware hierarchical decoding. It can obtain better or comparable performance than baselines, and achieve faster inference speed compared with previous methods with pre-trained language models.

- [x] [**KG-Prompt**](https://github.com/zjunlp/PromptKGC/tree/main/KGPrompt) (Jaunary 31, 2020): A prompt-tuning approach (knowledge collaborative fine-tuning) for low-resource knowledge graph completion. KG-Prompt leverages the structured knowledge to construct the initial prompt template and learn the optimal templates, labels and model parameters through a collaborative fine-tuning algorithm.  It can obtain state-of-the-art few-shot performance on FB15K-237, WN18RR, and UMLS.
