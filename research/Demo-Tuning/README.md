# Demo-Tuning

This is the implement of the paper "Contrastive Demonstration Tuning for Pre-trained Language Models". Demo Tuning is a novel pluggable, extensible, and efficient approach with contrastive demonstration tuning, which is free of demonstration sampling.

## Overview

Recent works have focused on automatically searching discrete or continuous prompts or optimized verbalizers, yet studies for the demonstration are still limited. Concretely, the demonstration examples are crucial for an excellent final performance of prompt-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel pluggable, extensible, and efficient approach named **contrastive demonstration tuning**, which is free of demonstration sampling.
