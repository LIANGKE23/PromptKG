# Implemented Models


# Quick Start

## Installation

### **Step1**

Create the conda env.

```shell

```

### **Step2**

Install the denpency.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run your first experiment

We first provide `link-prediction` as our example downstream task.

```shell
bash ./scripts/simkgc/fb15k.sh
```
